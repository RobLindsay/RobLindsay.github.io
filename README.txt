This repository hosts my github pages.  

The page was created to showcase my projects that I have worked on during my Dual Degree program at UT Dallas.  

Many of the assignments were very specific in the report/assignment submittal.  
	For instance, many of the data visualization reports are just pictures with no explanation.
	These submissions are done to the specified format dictated by the instructor.
	
Self Reflection:
	Revisiting many of these projects for the first time in a while has been fun.  In most cases, I am very proud
	of the quality of work that I submitted.  In a few, I could see how balancing a course load and the varrying  
	assignment due dates that come with multiple classes can have an effect on the final project you turn in.  In 
	some cases, you just have to decide what is good enough and roll with it.  
	
	I think the biggest challenge came from the machine learning projects that were very ambiguous in how we went 
	about each project.  We were given some specific questions to answer, but other than that, we were completely 
	on our own.  No code was provided to us or specifics as to how anything should be reported or visualized and 
	creativity was highly encouraged.  This was great becuase it gave me the opportunity to explore Python libraries
	on my own and simulated what the real world is like as you are trying to solve problems and searching for ways 
	that others may have done before you.  It also made me question my sanity at times as it seemed like I was 
	spending more time exploring python libraries and example documentation than I was on the actual assignment.
	I'd say the most frustrating thing about the ambiguity in these projects was that there was so much exploration
	and experimentation required to solve the problem, and this left very little time for formatting of the code or 
	annotating it.  In a professional setting, this is something that I acknowledge must be taken care of to allow 
	for easy translation by myself or anyone else who may revisit the code in the future.  
	
	A good example can be found in the 2nd Project I submitted for the Machine Learning class.  You can see in the 
	first part of the assignment where I am working with SVM, the notes are very good. For the second part of the 
	assignment on decision trees, the annotations are lacking in my opinion.  But overall, I am very happy with the 
	project itself, the report that accompanied it, and, of course, the grade that accompanied both!
